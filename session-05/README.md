## Task 2
### Description
How to make operating system control garbage collection.
### Solution
The operating system does provide Memory Management APIs that can be used to allocate and free memory manually, and programmers can use these APIs (depending on the programming language) to implement their own garabage collection algorithms, in addition to providing scheduling and interrupt handling mechanisms that can be used to pause program execution at appropriate intervals for garbage collection.
