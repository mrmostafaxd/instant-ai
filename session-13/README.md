# Session 13 Tasks

## Task 1

Create a text file that contains several lines of data in the following format:

```
name phone_number email_address
```

For example:

```
ahmed 0102345678 ahmed@gmail.com
```

Then, write a Python script that uses regular expressions to open the file and extract the data into three separate lists: one for the names, one for the phone numbers, and one for the email addresses. Print the lists at the end of the script.
