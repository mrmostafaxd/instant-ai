## Task 1

How to check if the variables inside a dataset are linearly related or not.

### Solution

To test if there relations between the variables inside the dataset are linear, one can apply a linear regression model on a subset of the data and compare the observed and predicted values using an appropriate metric, such as the R2 score. A low R2 score indicates that the linear model does not fit the data well, implying that the data set may have a non-linear relationship between the variables.

## Task 2

How to solve non-linear system of equations.

### Solution

The equations can be solved using the substituation method by picking an equation and substituting with it in the rest of the equations.

They can also be solved by Gaussian Gaussian Elimination by converting the non-linear factors to linear factors, then solving the equations to find the solution for the new equations, then compare the solution with the original non-linear factors to find their solutions.

## Task 3

Find the difference between probability sampling and non-probability sampling.

### Solution

Sampling is a technique of selecting individual members or a subset of the population to make statistical inferences from them and estimate the characteristics of the whole population.

Probability sampling means that every member of the population has a chance of being selected.

In a non-probability sample, individuals are selected based on non-random criteria, and not every individual has a chance of being included
